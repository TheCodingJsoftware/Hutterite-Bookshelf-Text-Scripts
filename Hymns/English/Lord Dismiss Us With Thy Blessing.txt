1. Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing;
Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each, Thy love possessing,
Triumph in redeeming grace.
O refresh us, O refresh us,
Traveling thro' this wilderness.

2. Thanks we give, and adoration,
For Thy gospel's joyful sound.
May the fruits of Thy salvation
In our hearts and lives abound.
Ever faithful, Ever faithful,
To the truth may we be found.
