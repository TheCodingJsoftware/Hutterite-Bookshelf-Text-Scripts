Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve
Waiting for the harvest and the time of reaping
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

CHORUS

Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows
Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilly breeze
By and by the harvest and the labor's ended
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

Go then ever weeping, sowing for the Master
Though the loss sustained, our spirits often grieve
When our weeping's over He will bid us welcome
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
