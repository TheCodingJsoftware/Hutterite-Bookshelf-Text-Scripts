When the Savior calls I will answer
When He calls for me I will hear
When the Savior calls I will answer
I'll be somewhere listening for my name.

CHORUS

I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening for my name (for my name)
I'll be somewhere listening, I'll be somewhere listening
I'll be somewhere listening for my name.

If my heart is right when He calls me
If my heart is right I will hear
If my heart is right when He calls me
I'll be somewhere listening for my name.

If my robe is white when He calls me
If my robe is white I will hear
If my robe is white when He calls me
I'll be somewhere listening for my name'
