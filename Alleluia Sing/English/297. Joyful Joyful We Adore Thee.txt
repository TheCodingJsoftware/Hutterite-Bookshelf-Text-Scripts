Joyful, joyful we adore Thee, God of glory, Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee, opening to the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness, drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness, fill us with the light of day.

All Thy works with joy surround Thee, earth and heaven reflect Thy rays
Stars and angels sing around Thee, center of unbroken grace
Field and forest, vale and mountain, flowry meadow, flashing sea
Chanting bird and flowing fountain, call us to rejoice in Thee.

Thou art giving and forgiving, ever blessing, ever blessed
Wellspring of the joy of living, ocean depth of happy rest
Thou Our Father, Christ Our Brother, all who live in love are Thine
Teach us how to love each other, lift us to the joy divine.

Mortals join the mighty chorus which the morning stars began
Father love is reigning o'er us, brother love binds man to man
Ever singing, march we onward, victors in the midst of strife
Joyful music leads us sunward, in the triumph song of life.
