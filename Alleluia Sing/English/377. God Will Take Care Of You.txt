Be not dismayed whate'er betide
God will take care of you
Beneath His wings of love abide
God will take care of you.

CHORUS

God will take care of you
Through every day, o'er all the way
He will take care of you
God will take care of you (take care of you).

Through days of toil when heart doth fail
God will take care of you
When dangers fierce your path assail
God will take care of you.

All you may need He will provide
God will take care of you
Nothing you ask will be denied
God will take care of you.

No matter what may be the test
God will take care of you
Lean, weary one, upon His breast
God will take care of you.
