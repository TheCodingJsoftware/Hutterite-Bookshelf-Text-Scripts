What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
What can make me pure within
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

CHORUS

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow
No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

For my cleansing this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
For my pardon this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Glory, glory, thus I sing
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
All my praise for this I bring
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
